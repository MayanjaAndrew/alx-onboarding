Set “n” to be equal to the number inputted
Set “sum” to zero

Using a For loop to calculate the sum of squares of “n” numbers
For loop conditions to execute it; 
        i is equal to 0, 
        i should be less than “n”, 
        for every step add one to i 
   Multiply value of i by i
   New value of sum is; sum plus i x i
   Repeat for loop process until value of i is equal to n,
Exit the loop;
Print or return last value of “sum”
